Question: The Pricing Summary Report Query provides a summary pricing report for all lineitems shipped as of a given date.  The date is within 60 - 120 days of the greatest ship date contained in the database. The query lists totals for  extended price, discounted extended price, discounted extended price plus tax, average quantity, average extended  price, and average discount. These aggregates are grouped by RETURNFLAG and LINESTATUS, and listed in ascending  order of RETURNFLAG and LINESTATUS. A count of the number of lineitems in each group is included.

Grade: Equal
Reason: The answer contains the same data values as the expected result.

Question: The Minimum Cost Supplier Query finds, in a given region, for each part of a certain type and size, the supplier who can supply it at minimum cost. If several suppliers in that region offer the desired part type and size at the same (minimum) cost, the query lists the parts from suppliers with the 100 highest account balances. For each supplier, the query lists the supplier's account balance, name and nation; the part's number and manufacturer; the supplier's address, phone number and comment information.

Question: The Shipping Priority Query retrieves the shipping priority and potential revenue, defined as the sum of l_extendedprice * (1-l_discount), of the orders having the largest revenue among those that had not been shipped as of a given date. Orders are listed in decreasing order of revenue. If more than 10 unshipped orders exist, only the 10 orders with the largest revenue are listed.

Question: The Local Supplier Volume Query lists for each nation in a region the revenue volume that resulted from lineitem transactions in which the customer ordering parts and the supplier filling them were both within that nation. The query is run in order to determine whether to institute local distribution centers in a given region. The query consid- ers only parts ordered in a given year. The query displays the nations and revenue volume in descending order by revenue. Revenue volume for all qualifying lineitems in a particular nation is defined as sum(l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount))

Question: The Forecasting Revenue Change Query considers all the lineitems shipped in a given year with discounts between DISCOUNT-0.01 and DISCOUNT+0.01. The query lists the amount by which the total revenue would have increased if these discounts had been eliminated for lineitems with l_quantity less than quantity. Note that the potential revenue increase is equal to the sum of [l_extendedprice * l_discount] for all lineitems with discounts and quantities in the qualifying range.

Question: The Product Type Profit Measure Query finds, for each nation and each year, the profit for all parts ordered in that year that contain a specified substring in their names and that were filled by a supplier in that nation. The profit is defined as the sum of [(l_extendedprice*(1-l_discount)) - (ps_supplycost * l_quantity)] for all lineitems describing parts in the specified line. The query lists the nations in ascending alphabetical order and, for each nation, the year and profit in descending order by year (most recent first).

Question: The Returned Item Reporting Query finds the top 20 customers, in terms of their effect on lost revenue for a given quarter, who have returned parts. The query considers only parts that were ordered in the specified quarter. The query lists the customer's name, address, nation, phone number, account balance, comment information and revenue lost. The customers are listed in descending order of lost revenue. Revenue lost is defined as sum(l_extendedprice*(1-l_discount)) for all qualifying lineitems.

Question: The Shipping Modes and Order Priority Query counts, by ship mode, for lineitems actually received by customers in a given year, the number of lineitems belonging to orders for which the l_receiptdate exceeds the l_commitdate for two different specified ship modes.

The late lineitems are partitioned into two groups, those with priority URGENT or HIGH, and those with a priority other than URGENT or HIGH.

Question: This query determines the distribution of customers by the number of orders they have made, including customers who have no record of orders, past or present. It counts and reports how many customers have no orders, how many have 1, 2, 3, etc. A check is made to ensure that the orders counted do not fall into one of several special categories of orders. Special categories are identified in the order comment column by looking for a particular pattern.
